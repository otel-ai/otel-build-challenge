# Revenue Manager Agent — Build Challenge
## Build an AI Revenue Manager for a hotel GM

## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts Postgres on port `5432` with:

- database: `hotel_hackathon`
- user: `hackathon`
- password: `hackathon`

Connection string:

```
postgresql://hackathon:hackathon@localhost:5432/hotel_hackathon
```

> **Important — the database starts empty.** `docker compose up` creates the
> tables (via `schema.sql`) but **there is no data seed.** You do **not** get the
> reservation dataset as a file. Your first job is to **build an ETL that scrapes
> the data from a public website and loads it into this database** — see the
> next section. The schema below tells you exactly what shape to load it into.

### Files
- `schema.sql` - creates the (empty) tables you will load into
- `docker-compose.yml` - boots a local Postgres instance

---

## Step 1 — Get the data: build an ETL (scrape → load)

There is **no seed file**. The reservation dataset lives on a **public website**,
and your first deliverable is an **ETL pipeline** that scrapes it and loads it
into your Postgres database. This is a deliberate part of the challenge — we want
to see that your team can build a real ingestion script, not just point an agent
at a database somebody else filled.

> **Data site:** **https://otel-hackathon-data-site.vercel.app**
> It renders the reservation data as HTML pages — a paginated
> [**reservation list**](https://otel-hackathon-data-site.vercel.app/reservations),
> a **detail page per reservation** (`/reservations/<id>`), a
> [**reference page**](https://otel-hackathon-data-site.vercel.app/reference)
> with the lookup tables, and a
> [**verify page**](https://otel-hackathon-data-site.vercel.app/verify) you can
> use to check your load. There is no JSON API and no CSV download; you have to
> scrape the rendered pages. The data is also **client-rendered** (delivered by
> the page's JavaScript, not in the initial HTML), so a plain `curl` returns an
> empty shell — drive a real browser.

### What "ETL" means here

1. **Extract** — scrape the data site with a browser-automation tool
   (**Playwright** is the expected choice). The pages are client-rendered, so a
   plain `curl` will not see the data — you need to drive a real browser, wait
   for content to render, page through the list, and follow each reservation into
   its detail page to capture the per-night stay rows and the fields that only
   appear on the detail view.
2. **Transform** — parse the scraped HTML into clean, typed records that match
   `schema.sql`: the **fact table** is one row per **reservation × stay_date**
   (see Section 4 — grain is the whole game), plus the three **lookup tables**
   (room types, market codes, channels) from the reference page.
3. **Load** — insert into the Postgres tables from the Quick start. Make the load
   **idempotent** (e.g. upsert on the primary keys / truncate-and-reload) so you
   can safely re-run it without creating duplicates.

### How often it runs

**Once is fine.** The dataset is effectively static for the duration of the
challenge — it does not change daily — so you do **not** need a scheduler or a
daily job. Run your ETL once to populate the database, and re-run it on demand if
you wipe the DB or want a fresh load. How you package it is your call: a
one-shot script you run locally, a deploy-once job, or a small container — pick
whatever your team prefers. We care that the pipeline is **correct, idempotent,
and reproducible**, not that it runs on a cron.

### What scores well

- A **robust scraper** that handles pagination and the list → detail drill-in,
  waits for rendered content, and doesn't silently drop rows.
- A **verification step** — after loading, check your row counts and a few
  aggregates against what the site shows (the site exposes a verify/summary view
  for exactly this). Prove your load is complete and correct.
- **Idempotency and reproducibility** — anyone can run it from scratch and get
  the same database.
- Clean separation of extract / transform / load, with the transform enforcing
  the correct grain and types.

Only once your database is populated does the agent work below make sense — the
agent reads the database **you** built.

---

## Step 2 — Build the agent with LangChain Deep Agents (required harness)

Once your ETL has populated the database (Step 1), build your Revenue Manager
Agent on top of it. You must build it using **LangChain Deep Agents**.

> **Read the docs first:** https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview

Deep Agents is an opinionated agent harness built on LangChain + LangGraph. It gives you planning, a virtual filesystem, subagents, skills, memory, and human-in-the-loop **out of the box** — you *configure* these capabilities, you don't hand-roll them. We are using this challenge to confirm that your team can do real agent engineering and that you understand the core concepts of the framework, not just call an LLM in a loop.

**The bar:** a single `create_deep_agent()` call with one SQL tool is a *fail*. We want to see you deliberately use the building blocks below and be able to explain *why* you reached for each one.

### 0.1 Install

```bash
pip install -qU deepagents langchain-anthropic   # or langchain-openai, etc.
```

Set the relevant API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and the Postgres connection string from the Quick start above.

### 0.2 What you build

Your entry point is a single `create_deep_agent(...)` call that you assemble from
the framework's building blocks — the model, your tools, a system prompt, your
skills, a filesystem backend, and the memory / human-in-the-loop machinery.
**Working out how these fit together from the documentation is part of the
test**, so we don't hand you the wiring. The [Deep Agents
docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) describe every
parameter — build from those.

### 0.3 Concepts we expect you to use

Use **all** of these building blocks, and be ready to explain *why* you reached
for each. We are not prescribing *how* — designing the solution is the point.

| Concept | What it is in Deep Agents | What we're looking for |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | Custom `@tool` functions you pass to the agent | A deliberately designed tool surface — you decide what the tools are, their arguments, and their return shapes (see the principle in 0.6). |
| **Skills** | On-demand `SKILL.md` files loaded via progressive disclosure | Skills are the heart of this challenge (see 0.7). We judge their **depth and attention to detail** directly. |
| **Subagents** | Specialised agents spawned via the built-in task tool | Delegate focused work to subagents with isolated context where it genuinely helps. |
| **Planning** | Built-in todo / planning tooling | Let the agent decompose multi-part questions into ordered steps. |
| **Memory / Filesystem** | Virtual filesystem + a long-term store | Persist intermediate work and hold a real multi-turn conversation. |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Approval interrupts | Gate anything sensitive or expensive behind an approval step. |
| **Model & system prompt** | `model=...`, `system_prompt=...` | A sharp revenue-manager persona that holds the answer style in Section 12. |
| **MCP (bonus)** | External tool servers via MCP | Optional. |

### 0.4 Skills use progressive disclosure

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (at minimum `name` and a
precise `description`) that the agent loads on demand — read the docs for the
exact format. How you structure, name, scope, and write your skills is your
decision, and is a large part of what we evaluate.

### 0.5 What scores well

- Correct, deliberate use of **all** the building blocks in 0.3 — and the ability
  to justify every choice.
- **The depth and quality of your skills** (0.7). This is the single biggest
  differentiator, and we probe it directly (see below).
- A tool layer that makes wrong answers hard — correct grain, cancellations, and
  the right date and revenue fields (see Sections 4–8).
- Answers that read like a sharp revenue manager, not a dashboard (Section 12).

**How we test skill depth.** We will ask **deliberately hard questions** that a
thin skill cannot answer well — questions that require correct decomposition, the
right judgment call, awareness of a subtle trap in the data, or a non-obvious
commercial recommendation. A surface-level skill produces a generic or wrong
answer; a well-crafted one shows real revenue-management thinking. **Your skills
are graded on what they actually make the agent capable of.**

### 0.6 Design principle: own your correctness (don't lean on raw `run_sql`)

Handing the model a single `run_sql(query)` tool and letting it write arbitrary
SQL is the easy path and a weak one: **you** lose control of correctness, and the
model can silently get the grain wrong (rows vs reservations), forget to exclude
cancellations, or pick the wrong date or revenue field. Strong solutions put
correctness in **their own code** — a deliberately designed tool layer with the
business rules baked in and **tested** — so the agent composes answers from
trustworthy building blocks instead of improvising SQL. How you design that
surface (what the tools are, their arguments, their return shapes, how you test
them) is yours to decide, and is part of what we evaluate.

### 0.7 The skills are the real test: teach the agent to *think* like a revenue manager

Most teams will write a skill that defines metrics. That makes the agent
*accurate*, not *insightful* — and it is not enough. What separates a strong
submission is a set of skills that encode the **judgment of an experienced
revenue manager**: not what the numbers are, but how to interpret them, what to
compare against, what trap to avoid, and what to actually recommend.

We are deliberately **not** giving you the heuristics, the thresholds, or a list
of skills to write. Discovering what an expert revenue manager actually knows —
and encoding it with real attention to detail — *is the challenge.* This is where
we spend most of our judging time, and where the hard questions in 0.5 are aimed.

A team that ships genuine revenue-management reasoning here — so the agent
delivers commercial judgment, not a dashboard read aloud — is demonstrating
exactly what this challenge is testing.

---

## Step 3 — Deploy your agent and submit (read this carefully)

**This is how you are evaluated.** We will **not** run your code, clone your
repo, or set anything up. We will simply **open the URL you send us, type
questions to your agent, and judge it on the answers it gives.** If the link
doesn't work, there is nothing to evaluate.

So your final deliverable is one thing: **a live URL where your agent is running
and ready to answer questions.**

### What the URL must be

A web page with a **chat box**: we type a revenue-manager question (e.g. *"What's
driving July?"*, *"Are we too dependent on OTA?"*), and your **Deep Agent
answers** — in plain English, with the numbers, like the examples in Section 11.
That's it.

- The answer must come **from your agent**, reading **your database** (the one
  your ETL filled in Step 1). No hard-coded or pre-written answers.
- The agent must be **live and responsive** during the evaluation window. If it
  sleeps or the database is down, you fail the evaluation even if your code is
  perfect — so make sure everything stays running.
- It does **not** need to look pretty. A plain chat box is completely fine. We
  judge the *answers*, not the design.

### Protect it (recommended)

Because the URL is public, anyone could find it and spam your agent (which costs
you money and could be abused). To prevent this, **put it behind a simple
username and password** (HTTP basic auth or a basic login screen is enough).

Then:
- **Share the URL** with us in your submission (it can be public).
- **Send the username and password privately** — DM them to me on **LinkedIn**.
  Do **not** put credentials in your README, your repo, or anywhere public.

### How to submit

**Build in your own repository.** Create a **new, separate Git repository of your
own** for your solution — do **not** fork this one. Put your ETL, your Deep Agents
wiring, your tools, skills, and subagents there. (This repo is just the brief; your
work lives in your repo.)

Then send us:

1. **The live agent URL.**
2. **The username + password** (via LinkedIn DM only — not in the repo).
3. **A link to your own code repository**, so we can see *how* you built it — your
   ETL, your Deep Agents wiring, your tools, your skills, your subagents. The
   live answers show us *what* it does; the repo shows us *how*. (You can keep it
   private and add us as a collaborator, or make it public — your call.)

### Deployment hints

You need three things running and reachable: your **database**, your **agent
backend**, and a **front-end** that talks to it.

- **Database:** a hosted Postgres (e.g. Supabase, Neon, Railway). Run your ETL
  once to fill it; a DB on your laptop won't be reachable by a deployed app.
- **API key:** set your model API key in the deployment environment — never
  commit it.

**Show your work in the UI.** We don't just want a final answer in a chat box —
we want to **see the agent working**: for each question, which **tools** it
called and which **skills** it loaded, streamed live as it runs. This is a strong
positive signal, because it lets us watch the reasoning *route* — did the right
skill fire, did it reach for the right tools. (Conveniently, in Deep Agents
loading a skill is itself a file-read tool call, so a UI that surfaces tool calls
shows skill usage too.) You do **not** need to expose the raw chain-of-thought —
tool and skill activity is the signal we want.

Because Deep Agents runs on **LangGraph**, the easiest path is to serve your agent
as a LangGraph app and connect a ready-made UI that already renders streaming
tool calls and subagent activity (e.g. the **deepagents UI** / **Agent Chat UI**)
rather than hand-build one. A small custom front-end that streams tool/skill
events is also fine. Plain **Streamlit** works but won't surface this detail well,
so prefer a UI that shows tool and skill calls.

### Submission checklist

- [ ] Database is hosted and loaded by my ETL (not on my laptop).
- [ ] Agent is deployed and answers questions live at a URL.
- [ ] URL is protected with a username/password.
- [ ] I built in my own separate repo (not a fork of this one).
- [ ] I've sent: the URL + credentials (LinkedIn DM) + my own code repo link.
- [ ] I left it running for the evaluation window.

## 1. What this dataset is for

This dataset is designed for a build challenge where you build a **Revenue Manager Agent for a hotel General Manager (GM)**.

Build a **Revenue Manager Agent for a Hotel General Manager**.

Using reservation data, detect what is changing in future business - pickup, cancellations, segment mix, and emerging risks or opportunities - and turn it into clear commercial judgment.

Show the GM what matters most, why it matters, and what action they should take next.

The agent should handle natural-language business questions such as:

- What revenue is on the books by month?
- What is driving July?
- Are we too dependent on OTA?
- How much business was cancelled in June?
- Which room type has the highest ADR?
- How much group business do we have?
- What changed in the last 7 days for future stays?

The agent should be able to:
1. understand the question,
2. query the dataset correctly,
3. return the answer in plain English,
4. explain the main drivers,
5. show numbers clearly,
6. mention assumptions or caveats when needed.

---

## 2. Important business context

This dataset comes from a hotel reservations context, but it has been simplified for the challenge.

You do **not** need to know hotel industry jargon in advance. This guide explains the business concepts and table meanings.

### Core idea
A hotel sells rooms for specific stay dates.

A reservation might be:
- created long before arrival,
- cancelled before arrival,
- direct or OTA,
- transient or group,
- one room or multiple rooms.

This dataset is designed to help a GM understand:
- business on the books,
- booking pace,
- segment mix,
- room type mix,
- cancellations,
- concentration risk,
- group vs transient demand.

---

## 3. Dataset overview

The dataset currently contains:

- **4 tables**
- **455 rows** in the main fact table: `reservations_hackathon`
- lookup tables for room types, market segments, and channels

### Tables
- `public.reservations_hackathon`
- `public.room_type_lookup`
- `public.market_code_lookup`
- `public.channel_code_lookup`

---

## 4. The most important concept: table grain

### `reservations_hackathon` is **not** one row per reservation

It is:

**one row per reservation x stay_date**

That means:
- if a reservation stays 3 nights, it creates 3 rows
- if a reservation has multiple rooms, `number_of_spaces` tells you how many rooms are attached
- counting rows is **not** the same as counting reservations

This is the single most important thing to understand.

### Example
A guest books 2 rooms for 3 nights.

That creates:
- 3 rows in `reservations_hackathon`
- each row has `number_of_spaces = 2`

So:
- **reservation count** = 1
- **stay rows** = 3
- **room nights** = 6

---

## 5. Business concepts

### Reservation
A hotel booking.

### Stay date
The actual night being stayed.

### Arrival date
The date the guest checks in.

### Departure date
The date the guest checks out.

### Booking date
When the reservation was created. In this dataset, that is `create_datetime`.

### OTB / On-the-books
Business that currently exists in the reservation data for future stay dates.

### ADR
Average Daily Rate. In simplified terms, revenue per room night.

### Room nights
How many rooms are occupied across nights.  
Example:
- 1 room for 3 nights = 3 room nights
- 2 rooms for 3 nights = 6 room nights

### OTA
Online Travel Agency, such as Booking.com or Expedia.

### Direct
Business that comes directly through the hotel’s own website / reservations / walk-ins.

### Group business
Reservations tied to a conference, corporate group, event, or similar multi-room booking.

### Transient business
Normal individual bookings, usually not group blocks.

### Lead time
Days between booking creation and arrival date.

## 8. Common pitfalls

## 8.1 Do not confuse rows with reservations
Counting rows is not the same as counting bookings. Think about what the correct approach is.

---

## 8.2 Do not confuse reservations with room nights

A reservation can cover multiple rooms. Make sure your room-night calculation accounts for this.

---

## 8.3 Be careful with cancelled bookings

Think about whether cancelled reservations should be included or excluded depending on the question being asked.

---

## 8.4 Know which date you are using

The dataset has multiple date fields. Make sure you use the right one for the question. Using the wrong date can produce a logically wrong answer even if the SQL runs.

---

## 8.5 Know which revenue field you need

There are two revenue columns in the dataset. Understand what each one represents and choose the right one for the question.

---

## 9. Business definitions and semantic clarity

A strong solution will define business metrics explicitly instead of improvising them every time. Your agent should have clear, consistent definitions for concepts like reservation count, room nights, revenue, ADR, and segment groupings.

How you define and group these is part of the challenge.

---

## 10. Why a semantic layer is a strong idea

Direct natural-language to SQL can be error-prone.

A strong team may create a semantic layer that defines:

* business metrics,
* default filters,
* dimension mappings,
* standard business rules.

This is powerful because it reduces common mistakes like:

* counting rows instead of reservations,
* mixing room revenue and total revenue,
* forgetting cancelled rows,
* confusing stay date and booking date.

A semantic layer is **not required**, but it is a strong differentiator and should score well if implemented clearly.

---

## 11. Example questions

These are the kinds of questions the Revenue Manager agent should handle.

### Examples

* What revenue is on the books by month?
* Which segments are driving July?
* How much of July is group business?
* Are we too dependent on OTA?
* What changed in the last 7 days for future stays?
* Which room type is generating the highest ADR?
* How much business was cancelled in June?
* What share of our future business is corporate?
* Which companies are contributing the most revenue?
* Is our business concentrated in a few large bookings?

---

## 12. Answer style

A good answer is not just raw SQL output. A weak answer names a single metric. A strong answer explains the drivers, quantifies the key numbers, highlights risks or opportunities, and speaks in language a GM would trust.

Think: what would a sharp revenue manager say in a morning briefing?

---

## 13. Final advice for teams

1. Decide whether the question is about stay date or booking date.
2. Be explicit about whether cancelled reservations are included.
3. Prefer clear business definitions for metrics like bookings, room nights, and revenue.
4. Return answers in plain English, not just raw query output.
5. When there is ambiguity, state your assumption.

## 16. Challenge objective

Build a **Revenue Manager Agent for a Hotel General Manager** that uses reservation data to detect what is changing in future business, turn it into clear commercial judgment, and recommend what action to take next.
